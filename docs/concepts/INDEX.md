## UI Concepts Explored

Historical exploration of UI approaches:
- Orbital Zen (spatial priority visualization)
- Creature Companion
- Music Tracker patterns

**Current Direction:** List-based UI is core/base. Orbital Zen planned as alternative theme (Phase 8 of infrastructure evolution). See [MULTI_SHELL_ARCHITECTURE.md](./MULTI_SHELL_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the technical strategy enabling multiple interaction models.

## Future Features

Ideas captured but not scheduled:
- Priority Queue architecture variants
- Theme systems
- BYOAI feasibility
- Advanced AI capabilities

See [FUTURE_CONSIDERATIONS.md](./FUTURE_CONSIDERATIONS.md) for details.
