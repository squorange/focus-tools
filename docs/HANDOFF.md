# Project Handoff Notes

## Project Overview
Focus Tools is an ADHD-friendly task management system exploring spatial visualization and AI integration.

## Current State (November 2024)
- Infrastructure: Set up with modular structure for multiple prototypes
- Selected Concept: Orbital Zen (spatial task organization)
- Documentation: PRD complete, concepts documented
- Next Phase: Build orbital-zen prototype

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Modular Structure**: Multiple prototypes in one repo for experimentation
2. **Orbital Zen First**: Balances innovation with feasibility
3. **AI Integration**: Body double functionality without character metaphor
4. **Tech Stack**: Next.js + Tailwind + Supabase (familiar from clinic planner)

## Claude Code Learnings
- Use filesystem operations for project setup
- Documentation updates can be batched
- Git operations work without GitHub MCP

## Context for Future Sessions
- User has ADHD/AuDHD - design for executive function support
- Spatial thinker - tasks as "cloud of objects"
- Previous experience with clinic planner project
- Learning goals: AI integration patterns, Claude Code workflows

## Next Steps
1. Create orbital-zen HTML/CSS prototype
2. Add interaction animations
3. Integrate mock AI chat panel
4. Test with real tasks
