# Orbital Zen

## Concept

A spatial task organization interface where tasks orbit around your current focus. Tasks closer to the center have higher priority, creating a visual representation of what's important right now.

## Key Features

- **Spatial Organization**: Tasks positioned in orbital rings based on priority
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Distance from center indicates urgency/importance
- **Calm Interface**: Smooth animations and minimal distractions
- **ADHD-Friendly**: Reduces decision paralysis through clear visual prioritization

## Interaction Model

- Drag tasks between orbital rings to adjust priority
- Click center task to focus and start working
- Completed tasks fade away smoothly
- New tasks appear at the outer ring

## Status

Prototype concept - not yet implemented
